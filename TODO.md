  - How can you set up your server and route so that your project remains scalable?

  - Create a separate module for your processing functionality

  - You are only required to work with jpg files

  - At a minimum, you should have at least one test for your endpoint and at least one test for your image processing

  - Add caching to your application so that repeated requests to your endpoint use pre-stored images

  - Think of edge-cases. Should they get different error messages based on what's wrong?


  - Does stopping and restarting your server cause any issues?
  - Does your user get feedback when something goes wrong?
  - Is your code easy to follow? Comments?

  - Provided all necessary information in your readme file, so your reviewer knows how to test your API.
